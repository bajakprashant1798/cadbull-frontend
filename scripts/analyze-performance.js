üîç API Performance Analysis for CadBull Categories
=================================================

This analysis will help identify which API calls are causing the 2-8 second response times.

Key Areas to Monitor:
1. Backend API Response Times (should be < 500ms)
2. Frontend API Call Overhead (should be < 100ms)
3. Database Query Performance (should be < 200ms)
4. S3 URL Generation (should be < 50ms)
5. Redis Cache Performance (should be < 10ms)

Expected vs Actual Performance:
- getAllCategories: Expected < 100ms | Production: ?ms
- getallsubCategories: Expected < 150ms | Production: ?ms  
- getProjectsBySubcategory: Expected < 500ms | Production: ?ms (localhost 467ms ‚úÖ)

Performance Bottleneck Indicators:
‚ö†Ô∏è  > 2000ms: Critical - Immediate optimization needed
‚ö†Ô∏è  > 1000ms: Slow - Optimization recommended  
‚ö†Ô∏è  > 500ms: Attention - Monitor closely
‚úÖ < 500ms: Good performance

To run this analysis:
1. Deploy the updated code with timing logs
2. Visit category pages and monitor console logs
3. Look for these log patterns:

Backend Timing Patterns:
- üöÄ [API-START] requestId - Function started
- üìä [API-DB] requestId - Database operation: Xms
- üîó [API-S3] requestId - S3 operation: Xms  
- ‚ö° [API-CACHE] requestId - Redis operation: Xms
- ‚úÖ [API-COMPLETE] requestId - Total time: Xms

Frontend Timing Patterns:
- üöÄ [FRONTEND-API-START] requestId - API call started
- üìä [FRONTEND-API-STAGE] requestId - Stage: Xms
- ‚úÖ [FRONTEND-API-COMPLETE] requestId - Total time: Xms

Focus Areas for "Projects" Category Timeouts:
1. Check if getProjectsBySubcategory takes > 2000ms
2. Look for database connection timeouts  
3. Monitor S3 URL generation for large result sets
4. Check Redis cache hit rates

Expected Log Analysis Results:
- Localhost: All operations should be < 500ms
- Production: Identify which specific operation exceeds 2000ms
- Network: Frontend ‚Üí Backend should be < 100ms additional overhead

Next Steps After Analysis:
1. Identify the slowest operation from logs
2. Focus optimization on that specific bottleneck
3. Consider production-specific optimizations (connection pooling, caching, etc.)
