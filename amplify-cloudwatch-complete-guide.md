# üöÄ Complete Amplify CloudWatch Setup Guide

## Step 1: Find Your Amplify App
1. Go to AWS Amplify Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. Find your `cadbull-frontend` app
3. Note your app ID (it's in the URL)

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables
In your Amplify app console:

**Go to: App settings ‚Üí Environment variables**

Add these variables:
```
   ```
   ENABLE_CLOUDWATCH_LOGS=true
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   MONITOR_PERFORMANCE=true
   ```
TRACK_API_CALLS=true
TRACK_PAGE_LOADS=true
```

## Step 3: Find Your Lambda Function Name
Your Amplify app creates Lambda functions. To find them:

1. Go to AWS Lambda Console
2. Search for functions containing your app name
3. Function name format: `amplify-cadbull-frontend-main-xxxxxxxxx`
4. Note this name - you'll need it for CloudWatch

## Step 4: CloudWatch Log Groups
Your logs will appear in these locations:

### Automatic Lambda Logs:
- **Function logs**: `/aws/lambda/amplify-cadbull-frontend-main-xxxxxxxxx`
- **Build logs**: Available in Amplify Console

### Custom Logs (Optional - for advanced monitoring):
Create these in CloudWatch Console:
- `/aws/amplify/cadbull-frontend/performance`
- `/aws/amplify/cadbull-frontend/cost-tracking`

## Step 5: Deploy and Test
1. Deploy your app with the new environment variables
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Navigate to your homepage to trigger ISR
4. Check CloudWatch logs

## Step 6: View Your Logs

### In CloudWatch Console:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/
2. Navigate to: Logs ‚Üí Log groups
3. Find: `/aws/lambda/amplify-cadbull-frontend-main-xxxxxxxxx`
4. Click on the log group
5. Look for log streams (each request creates a new stream)

### What You'll See:
```
üß™ [AMPLIFY-LOG] About to call projects API
üåê AMPLIFY-API: {"timestamp":"...","type":"API_CALL","endpoint":"getallprojects"...}
üß† AMPLIFY-MEMORY: {"timestamp":"...","type":"MEMORY_USAGE","page":"Homepage"...}
üí∞ AMPLIFY-COST: {"timestamp":"...","type":"COST_METRICS","page":"Homepage"...}
üöÄ AMPLIFY-PERFORMANCE: {"timestamp":"...","type":"PAGE_PERFORMANCE","page":"Homepage"...}
```

## Step 7: Use Log Insights for Analysis

### Go to: CloudWatch ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Insights

### Select log group: `/aws/lambda/amplify-cadbull-frontend-main-xxxxxxxxx`

### Query 1: Most Expensive Pages
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /AMPLIFY-COST/
| parse @message /AMPLIFY-COST: (?<data>.*)/
| filter ispresent(data)
| parse data /"page":"(?<page>[^"]*)".*"totalCost":"(?<totalCost>[^"]*)/
| stats sum(totalCost), count() as requests by page
| sort sum(totalCost) desc
```

### Query 2: Slowest Pages
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /AMPLIFY-PERFORMANCE/
| parse @message /AMPLIFY-PERFORMANCE: (?<data>.*)/
| filter ispresent(data)
| parse data /"page":"(?<page>[^"]*)".*"totalTime":(?<totalTime>[^,}]*)/
| stats avg(totalTime), max(totalTime), count() by page
| sort avg(totalTime) desc
```

### Query 3: API Performance
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /AMPLIFY-API/
| parse @message /AMPLIFY-API: (?<data>.*)/
| filter ispresent(data)
| parse data /"endpoint":"(?<endpoint>[^"]*)".*"duration":(?<duration>[^,}]*)/
| stats avg(duration), max(duration), count() by endpoint
| sort avg(duration) desc
```

## Step 8: Set Up Cost Alerts

### Create CloudWatch Alarm:
1. Go to CloudWatch ‚Üí Alarms
2. Create alarm
3. Metric: Custom metric from your logs
4. Condition: When cost exceeds threshold
5. Action: Send SNS notification

## Step 9: Monitor Your Costs

### Daily Monitoring:
Run this query to see daily costs:
```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /AMPLIFY-COST/
| parse @message /AMPLIFY-COST: (?<data>.*)/
| filter ispresent(data)
| parse data /"estimatedCost":\{"totalCost":"(?<totalCost>[^"]*)/
| bin(@timestamp, 1d) as day
| stats sum(totalCost) as daily_cost by day
| sort day desc
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see logs:
1. ‚úÖ Check environment variables are set
2. ‚úÖ Verify deployment completed successfully
3. ‚úÖ Ensure you visited the homepage after deployment
4. ‚úÖ Check the correct log group name
5. ‚úÖ Wait 2-3 minutes for logs to appear

### If logs are missing data:
1. ‚úÖ Verify Next.js config allows console.info/warn/error
2. ‚úÖ Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
3. ‚úÖ Ensure API calls are completing successfully

### Cost Monitoring Tips:
1. üéØ Focus on pages with highest execution time
2. üíæ Monitor memory usage patterns
3. üåê Optimize slow API calls
4. üìä Track ISR cache hit rates
5. ‚ö° Identify performance bottlenecks

## Expected Results

After setup, you'll see:
- **Page Performance**: Which pages take longest to generate
- **API Performance**: Which API calls are slowest
- **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption per page
- **Cost Analysis**: Estimated AWS costs per page
- **Error Tracking**: Any issues during page generation

This gives you complete visibility into what's costing you money and where to optimize!
